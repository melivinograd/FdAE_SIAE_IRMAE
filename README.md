# Project Title

This repository contains the models used for dimensionality reduction implemented in TensorFlow, applied to a Rayleigh-BÃ©nard system. This repository accompanies the work outlined in the following paper: [Paper Title](link).

## Outline

### Files and Directories

- **model.py**: Contains the implementation of the dimensionality reduction models: FdAE, IRMAE and SIAE.
- **train.py**: Includes the training scripts for the models.
- **args.json**: A configuration file containing the arguments and hyperparameters used for training and model configuration.
- **singular.py**: Handles the computation of the spectrum of singular values for IRMAE.
- **iqr.py**: Contains functions for computing the relevant dimensions of the SIAE.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used throughout the project for data loading.
- **data/**: Directory containing the data used for the experiments. For more details, see the [data/README.md](data/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Configure the model: Modify the `args.json` file to set the desired parameters and hyperparameters for the model and training.

2. Train the model: Run the `train.py` script to start the training process.
```bash
python3 train.py
```

3. Analyze the results: Use `singular.py` and `iqr.py` to analyze the results and extract insights from the trained models.

### Data
The data used for this project is located in the `data/` directory. For more information on the data, refer to the `data/README.md` file.
